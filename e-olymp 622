/*At informatics lessons you have probably been taught to transform the numbers from
one number system to another, and to perform other similar operations. It's time to 
demonstrate this knowledge. Find the number of ones in binary representation of a number.

Input
One integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 2 ∙10^9).

Output
Print the number of ones in binary representation of n.*/
